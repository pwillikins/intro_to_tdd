# string calculator
# The class is not initialized with anything special.
# There is one method called add that adheres to the following rules:
# If the empty string is passed, the method returns 0.
# Otherwise the method returns the sum of the numbers in the string. For example, if the string "1" is passed
# then the calculator returns 1. If the string "1,2,7" is passed, then the method returns 10.
# The delimiter can be specified at initialization time. In the above examples, the delimiter was the string ",".
# Any calls to add will use that delimiter.
