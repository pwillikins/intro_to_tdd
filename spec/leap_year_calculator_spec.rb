# The class is not initialized with anything special. You will call a method called yes?
# that will tell you if it is a leap year or not.
# The year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. (2001 is not a leap year but 1996 is a leap year)
# The year is leap year if it is divisible by 100 and divisible by 400.
# If it is only divisible by 100, it is not a leap year. (1900 is not a leap year but 2000 is a leap year)
